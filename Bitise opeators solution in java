Bitwise operators are useful when we want to work with bits. Here, we'll take a look at them.

Given three positive integers a, b and c. Your task is to perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
1. d = a ^ a
2. e = c ^ b
3. f = a & b
4. g = c | (a ^ a)
5. h = ~e
Note: ^ is for xor. The working of bitwise operators can be found here.

Example:

Input:
a = 4
b = 8
c = 2
Output:
0
10
0
2
-11
Constraints:
1 <= A, B, C <= 106

 



solution in java

lass Geeks {
    // Function to perform bitwise manipulations
    // a, b and c are input integers
    static void bitWiseOperation(int a, int b, int c) {

        // code here
        int d = a^a;
        int e = c^b;
        int f = a&b;
        int g = c|(a^a);
        int h = ~e;
        System.out.println(d);
        System.out.println(e);
        System.out.println(f);
        System.out.println(g);
        System.out.println(h);
    }
}
