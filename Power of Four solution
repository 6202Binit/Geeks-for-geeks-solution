Given a number N, check if N is power of 4 or not.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 64
Output: 1
Explanation:
43= 64
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 75
Output : 0
Explanation :
75 is not a power of 4.
Your task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPowerOfFour() which takes an integer N and returns 1 if the number is a power of four else returns 0.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

solution:-
class Solution
{
    int isPowerOfFour(long n)
    {
	// Your code here
	if (n == 0) return 0;
        
         while (n % 4 == 0) n /= 4;
         
         if(n==1) return 1;
         else return 0; 
    }
}
