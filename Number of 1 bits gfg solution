Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
2
Explanation:
Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
8
Output:
1
Explanation:
Binary representation is '1000' 
So the count of the set bit is 1.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function setBits() which takes an Integer N and returns the count of number of set bits.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109


solution in java:
approach:
1)- first initialize the sum with 0 value
2)-Iterate the loop 
3)-define a p integer value which is shift the value of i by 1
4)-and operation between p and n . if p and n value is eual to p value then increase the value of sum 
5)-return sum value 

class Solution {
    static int setBits(int N) {
        // code here
        // int c = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<32;i++){
            int p = 1<<i;
            if((N&p)==p){
                sum++;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
